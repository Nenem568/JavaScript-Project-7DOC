# JavaScript-Project-7DOC
HTML, CSS and JavaScript Project - 7DaysOfCode

This is a project made by Ikaro Felix with the ideas and suggestions from a challenge hosted by Alura.

The project consists of creating a site to show lists of digital contents, being possible to search for other contents
and making a personal list with favorite contents and storing it on the localStorage of each user.

The focus is working with JavaScript and the API from TMDB (The Movie Database) - https://www.themoviedb.org/
